## Welcome

This is idisyncratic and highly variable collection of science and coding resources, with an emphasis on physics. I will try and maintain some sort of index in [the wiki](https://github.com/ProfStick/psg2u/wiki) but I cant make any promises. Just consider this site a testament to entropy.

### OK but now what?

Wondering what to do now that you are here? Why not look at the Physic's $\LaTeX$ [Cookbook](./Physics/physics_latex_cookbook.md)
